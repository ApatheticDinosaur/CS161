#### Branching / Merging Strategy
To reduce chance of merging catastrophe, we're going to use some form of branching
and merging strategy. Here's how we can do it:

- Each project member creates a branch named after them.
- Each project member does work on their respective branch.
- Every time someone wants to merge back to master, create a pull request from this page: https://github.com/chaoservices/CS161/pulls
- Someone will then take a look at the pull request and merge them if satisfactory. 
- Each project member needs to rebase frequently from master to their own branch to make sure their branch 
is up-to-date.
